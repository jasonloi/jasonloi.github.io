	<br>

	<p>Hey there, I'm Jason. I enjoy romantic walks from the library to the computer lab and watching the sun set over Scotia Bank Arena (home of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors). I love working on exciting and challenging projects, playing pick-up hockey and basketball, and recording my own tracks. I believe that all things-without exception-are achievable with enough grit, passion, and a little bit of luck. I believe in asking for help and helping those you can. I believe in living through your beliefs and following the path that optimizes happiness.</p>
